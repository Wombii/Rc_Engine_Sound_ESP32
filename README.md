# Changes by Wombii, Work in progress:
Based on v2.4, but updated with v2.5 esc pulse change
## Added:
 - SBUS input
 - Simple serial input and calibration change
 - TTGO_Display tft display
 - Calibration via button press
 - 2 Siren sounds (alternating)
 - Dynamic intro/loop/outro horn (horn sounds for as long as switch is held down)
 - Second brake sound when applying brakes
 - Different logic function for reverse and brake sound triggering, separate from other functions
 
## Possibly fixed?:
 - slow ramping up and down for brake sounds to avoid files having to start and end at -180 without popping
 
## Other changes:
- Moved functions into different files to make the program easier to navigate for humans (or just me)
- Moved sound files to subfolders for same reason as above
- engineMassSimulation is split up into 3 sub functions to make testing easier:
throttle curve, mass simulation, convert throttle value to interrupt interval
 
## Disabled for now:
 - esc out
 - led out
 - shaker out
 - indicator tick tock sound
 - pwm, ppm and serial in
 
# --- Original readme below ---

# This is an Arduino RC engine sound generator for ESP32
It's based on the ATmega 328 version: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/Rc_Engine_Sound
and on bitlunis Halloween example: https://github.com/bitluni/MotionPumpkin

## Features:
- Many selectable engine sounds and startup sounds for cars and trucks
- Sound files up to 22'050Hz, 8bit, mono can be used
- Works best with a PAM8403 amplifier module, connected to pin 25, via a 10kOhm potentiometer
- The horn is played on pin 26 (see wiring instructions in code)
- The engine RPM is calculated according to RC signal input on pin 13 *** CAUTION, 3.3V max.! *** 330 Ohm resistors on all I/O pins recommended!
- Fire truck sounds, police sounds, Swiss post bus sound
- Truck air brake sounds
- Truck reversing beep
- Gear shifting is simulated in "curves.h"
- Light effects: headlights, tail lights, brake lights, reversing light, blue light
- Engine vibration simulation, using a shaker motor with excentric weight
- Vehicle mass simulation (connect your crawler type ESC to pin 33)
- Use an ESP32, CPU frequency must be set to 240MHz

## New in V 0.1:
- Runs on an ESP32 (240MHz)
- It's still quick and dirty, but works with the included V8 short course truck idle sound
- sounds way better than the ATmega 328 version, thanks to  22'050Hz sampling rate (instead of 8'000Hz)

## New in V 0.2:
- Many new 22'050Hz, 8bit sound files generated, mostly the same as in the ATmega 328 version, but in better quality :-)

## New in V 0.3:
- Engine start / stop implemented, including starter sounds
- Three different start sounds available
- Horn implemented. It is played on pin 26 (see wiring instructions in code) triggered by switch on input 12
- Two different horn sounds available
- The horn can play in parallel with the variable speed engine sound!
- For easier access, the "settings.h" file was renamed in "Adjustments.h"

## New in V 0.4:
- volume offset bug fixed
- added the typical Swisss post bus horn, an American police siren, a European Feuerwehr Martinshorn and a car horn
- added the varible "shifted", which allows to select between linear and shifted engine rpm response
- added schematic

## New in V 0.5:
- added idle sound volume adjustment variable "idleVolumePercentage" in "Adjustments.h"
- added Union Pacific 2002 SD70M 16 cylinder Diesel locomotive sounds
- added Jaguar XJS HE car sound (bad quality)
- added "pwmHornTrigger" variable in Adjustments.h", which allows to trigger the horn, using a PWM signal. Allows to use standard receivers

## New in V 0.6:
- fixed slow engine RPM response: The RC signal pulsewidth is now only read every 100ms, so much more processing time is available for other things

## New in V 0.7:
- fixed auto throttle zero calibration bug
- fixed "gap" bug, if sounds were triggered in PWM mode
- PWM mode now allows to trigger 2 sounds

## New in V 0.8:
- volume offset bug was back and is fixed again!
- improved sound quality of Union Pacific 2002
- Detroit Diesel truck added
- Sine test tones added
- M2 sound added

## New in V 0.9:
- Humvee Diesel engine sound added
- Truck pneumatic brake release sound added

## New in V 1.0:
- Engine now slowing down, if switched off, not just fading out
- Fader bug fixed, now working smoothly
- HG P408 sounds added

## New in V 1.1:
- Truck reversing beep sound added
- Can play in parallel with other additional sound and with variable speed engine sound!

## New in V 1.2:
- Light functions added: reversing light, beacons (blue light), headlights, taillights with integrated brake lights
- My "statusLED" library is required: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/statusLED

## New in V 1.3:
- Irish fire truck horn
- Double flash blue lights option
- US fire truck air horn and air siren

## New in V 1.4:
- Indicator (turn signal) support added
- RC signals now handled as arrays in order to simplify auto zero calibration of multiple channels

## New in V 1.5:
- More Detroit Diesels added

## New in V 1.51:
- Solved issue: redefinition of 'const unsigned int sampleRate'

## New in V 1.6:
- Servo input channels rearranged to match the pinout of the "Micro RC" receiver (you can change it in the pin assignment section)
- Cleaned up the code a bit
- An updated version (16 timers) of my "statusLED" library is required: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/statusLED
- Added experimental support for serial communication with my "Micro RC" receiver: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/Micro_RC_Receiver
- Uncomment "#define SERIAL_COMMUNICATION" in Adjustments.h
- Connect pin 36 "VP" to pin "TXO" of the receiver (disable "TXO_momentary1" & "TXO_toggle1" in vehicleConfig.h)
- The "RC Servo Signals" are not required in this mode!
- Added Scania R500 V8 sounds

## New in V 1.7:
- Added shaker motor control on pin 23. Simulates engine vibration. IRLZ44N Mosfet and freewheel diode 1N5819 required
- Shaker power can be adjusted with the variables "shakerMin" & "shakerMax" in Adjustments.h
- Driver schematic down below
- I'm using a shaker motor from the G.T.Power kit 103061 (this controller is crap, but the accessories are useful)
- Foglight and side light pins moved to pins 18 & 19

## New in V 1.8:
- LED pins changed for trailer light driver
- Horn sounds, siren sounds & additional sounds variable names changed! ---> Replace them all!
- Added more horns
- Added indicator (blinker) ticking sound
- Added independent volume adjustment for every sound
- Engine sound volume is now throttle dependent (adjustable)

## New in V 1.9:
- Kenworth W900 added
- Initial PPM signal input on pin 34 added. For now usable for steering and throttle signal. Uncomment "#define PPM_COMMUNICATION", if you want to use it.

## New in V 2.0:
- Swiss post bus horn moved to category "sirens" ---> Replace existing .h file!
- Experimental ESC output (do not use it). Latest statusLED library update required: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/statusLED
- Mack truck sounds added

## New in V 2.1:
- Additional turbo sound (playing in parallel with engine sound), volume and throttle dependent volume adjustable
- Caterpillar 3406B sound added
- VW Beetle sound added
- Indicator direction adjustable with "INDICATOR_DIR" = "true" or "false"
- Shaker rpm now adjustable for engine start, idle, full throttle & shutdown

## New in V 2.2:
- Support for crawler ESC (with direct brake) on pin 33. Vehicle mass simulation with proportional brake! Tested in Tamiya King Hauler (REELY Model No H0050 ESC) and working fine, but use it at your own risk! If you want to test it, connect ESC to pin 33 of the ESP32 instead of the receiver output.
- LED pins rearranged  to fit my board layout (you can change it in the pin assignment section)
- Scania R620 sound added

## New in V 2.3:
- Reversing light, reversing beep and brake light behaviour changed in order to interact correctly with the new vehicle mass simulation
- ESC is locked, if engine is not running ;-)
- Air brake sound now triggered correctly, as soon as the brake pedal is released
- I'm really amazed about this update! The vecihle almost behaves like a real truck now.

## New in V 2.4:
- Bug fixed: direct transition from state "braking backwards" to "driving backwards" now working
- failsafe function for serial signal added. Emergency brake is triggered in case of RC signal loss (serial & PWM mode only, PPM will follow)

## On the todo list:
- solving ticking noise issue in serial communication mode
- adding more sounds
- adding brake sound
- cleaning up code
- adding schematic for LED wiring (for now pinout see code)

## Ho to create new sound arrays:

### Audacity:
- Import the sound file you want in Audacity
- Convert it to mono, if needed
- on the bottom left, select project frequency 22'050Hz
- cut the sound to one engine cycle. Zoom in to find the exact zero crossing
- adjust the volume, so that the entire range is used
- select > export audio > WAV > 8-bit-PCM
- note, that the files should be as short as possible: search for a repeating sound pattern and cut it to this length

### Convert the wav file with bitlunis converting tool:
- open https://bitluni.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Audio2Header.html
- select the generated wav file from Audacity
- select "normalize"
- select "resample" and the frequency (22'050 recommended)
- a .h file is generated and downloaded
- move the .h file to your sketch directory

### Processing the new header file with your sound:
- include this .h file in "settings.h"

### Compiling the new sketch:
- compile and upload the sketch in Arduino IDE
- the new engine should now run...
